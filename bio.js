    bio: 'After an undergraduate degree in Linguistics, Brenna knew that she wanted to combine a career in languages with global experience. Eager to see the world, she worked for a brief stint as a flight attendant before turning her focus back towards languages in the form of front end development. Eventually she found her way to Turing School where she worked to solidify these skills on the backend, providing the technical expertise to reach into communities, solve problems, and spread knowledge. As a Teaching Assistant at Turing, Brenna brings these language skills to more students, helping to position a new generation of programmers to solve problems and make the world more accessible to those without access.',
